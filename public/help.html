<p>
    !This app is offered with no support at all!
</p>
<h2>Installing zoom roulette</h2>
<p>
<ul>
    <li>Go to <a href="/">the zoom roulette home page</a></li>
    <li>Click on the add to slack button. Authenticate the app</li>
    <li>Once you get the success message (you may have to wait until your admin approves the app and do it again), click the link to authenticate your zoom account</li>
    <li>Done!</li>
</ul></p>
<h2>Using zoom roulette</h2>
<p>
<ul>
    <li>In a slack channel of your choosing, type "/zoomroulette" to start a chat with 1 person or, for example, "/zoomroulette 3" to allow 3 others in the room</li>
    <li>You will see 2 messages in the channel. Make sure to click the "start the meeting" button and <b>NOT</b> the "jump in" button. Leave that one for your mystery guests</li>
    <li>Open the zoom room and wait for your match!</li>
</ul></p>
<h2>Allowing others to spin the roulette</h2>
<p>
    Once Zoom Roulette is installed, this is easy: the first time they try to use the command, they'll get a link to go through the setup flow. Once completed, they can use the command just like you!
